# ama_module

This assessment has gone pretty awfully and I am leaving this in a non-working state.

I left the accessing of the giphy api until last and have discovered that the api_key at https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI does not work. I would need to register for a key but really have only 10 minutes left.

My submit and validate functions are not being called, perhaps I am doing something stupid here but I was also having issues with my local dev environment.

I added the giphy_api_key as a variable in the install hook to allow for later making this an admin configuration option.
